tcltk2 news
===========

Version 1.0-8
-------------
- Most windows executables were removed. The rest is in /win and a configure.win
  / cleanup mechanism is used to install them under Windows only.

- BinaryFiles is added to declare these binaries.

- An error preventing system fonts to load in tk2fonts is corrected (thanks to
  B. Ripley).

- When the package was installed on a path with spaces, the SystemFonts.exe
  program was not executed properly under Windows. Quoting the command for
  system() solved the problem (thanks to Pascal Hirsh).

- Tile version of paned widget is disabled because it does not work any more
  with R 2.9.0 - Tcl/Tk 8.5.
