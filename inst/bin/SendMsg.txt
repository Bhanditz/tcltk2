====================================================
    SendMsg 2.1 - Window Message Posting Utility
(c) 2005 Maximum Output Software - www.maxoutput.com
====================================================

The SendMsg utility is used to post messages to various windows in the
Windows operating system using the built-in messaging subsystem.  Messages
which can be posted include, (but are not limited to) closing, hiding, resizing,
and user-defined messages as well.  If you are not familiar with how the
messaging system works, please consult the Windows SDK, or the Microsoft
MSDN library for more information, specifically the SendMessage and PostMessage
and related system calls.

The utility is designed to run from a command line.  It has no graphical output.
Messages can be posted to windows based on their title text, classname, or
handle.

In addition to posting messages, this utility can also be used to list windows
which match a certain criteria.

==================
Installing SendMsg
==================

Copy the SENDMSG.EXE and CONST.TXT files to a directory on your system path.
For Windows 95/98/Me we recommend the Windows\Command directory.  For NT/2000/
XP/2003 we recommend placing the files in the WINNT or Windows directory.

==============
SendMsg Syntax
==============

We recommend using a command prompt to learn how to use the utility.  Once you
have mastered its basic usage, you can add the utility to batch files, or run
it from any utility which allows you to launch applications.

The format of the command line is as follows: (this information is also 
available by running the SENDMSG with the /? parameter)

SendMsg {switches} [SearchStr] {Message} {wParam} {lParam}

  Switches:
     /CLASS or /TEXT   Search window classnames/titles
     /NOWAIT       Post message without waiting for result
     /[IN]VISIBLE  Include only [in]visible windows
     /TOP          Include only top-level windows
     /PAUSExxx     Delay xxx seconds after sending each message
     /EXAMPLES     Show example command lines

  SearchStr   String to search for.  Wildcards ? and * allowed
              SearchStr is NOT case sensitive
              Use "double quotations" if SearchStr contains spaces
  Message     Message to send.  If omitted, find windows only
              Constants in CONST.TXT [+/- offset] allowed
  wParam      wParam parameter.  If omitted, use "0" as default
  lParam      lParam parameter.  If omitted, use "0" as default

All numeric values can be listed in either decimal or $hexadecimal.

=====================
Example command lines
=====================

     SENDMSG /CLASS #32770 WM_NULL+0 0 0
          Sends the WM_NULL+0 message to all windows with class name #32770

     SENDMSG "Microsoft Word*" WM_CLOSE
          Sends the WM_CLOSE message to all Microsoft Word* windows

     SENDMSG "My Application" WM_USER+50 47 32
          Sends the WM_USER+50 message to My Application window

     SENDMSG /TEXT /VISIBLE M*
          List all visible windows with title beginning with M

     SENDMSG *
          List all windows

     SENDMSG /VISIBLE /TOP *
          List all visible top-level windows

===========
Pipe Output
===========

As with most command-line utilities, its output can be piped to a file:

     SENDMSG /VISIBLE /TOP * >PIPEFILE.TXT

=================
Message Constants
=================

Several common message constant values (such as WM_CLOSE, etc) are defined 
in the CONST.TXT file.  As long as this file is located in the same 
directory as the SENDMSG.EXE file these constants can be used in your 
command line.  In addition, an offset can be used: WM_USER+50.  If you
wish to add additional constants, edit the CONST.TXT file and add them
in the same format as the other constants listed.

==========================
Why Is This Software FREE?
==========================

We wrote the SendMsg program for internal use and found it to be quite
useful for shutting down applications in batch files, controlling our
backup software (FileBack PC) from within batch files, showing and hiding
windows, and other various window-related utilities.  We thought that
something useful to us might be useful to others.  As we never intended
to sell it, it didn't seem logical to charge anything for it.  However,
we do hope that as a "thank you" to us you might stop by our web site
and take a look at the other software we do offer.
