TclTk2 - To do list:
--------------------
- A bug appeared with mclistbox: selecting an item causes a Tcl error -state
  not defined.

- Despite I changed ::msgcat::mclocale to de, tk2chooseFont() is still in English (but it
  works for fr... why

- tile.use(FALSE) after loading tile does not work with tk2chooseFont()

- How to make TkTable available to other systems?

- Rework tk2edit() [takes numeric only and return characters for the moment!
  rework also the button bar]

- Add twapi, toolbar, tkdnd, datefield and swaplist

- Rework the code to detect and work with ActiveState install under Linux

- Check that the winico install is not installed for other systems

- For the tips: select background color and font from style (same for bwidgets)

- The package help file

- Tcl/Tk features to add:
  + info
  + update Idle tasks (update idletasks)
  + bgerror
  + correct handling of catch result => procedure for that
  + error to generate tcl errors
  + exit to end the application?
  + see if there is no 'file' stuff that could be useful for R
  + interp and after for delayed execution of code
  + memory
  + package
  + pkg_mkIndex
  + puts: write code from Tcl to the R console
  + resource to manipulate Macintosh resources
  + tclvars
  + unknown
  + A function to display the Tcl/Tk help and additional package help from R
  + Use of the msgcat Tcl package
  + add tclsh and wish as executables!
  + easier definition and retrieval of bindings (+ keysyms) and events
  + button, canvas, checkbutton, entry, frame, label, labelframe, listbox, menu,
    menubutton, message, pannedwindow, radiobutton, scale, scrollbar, spinbox,
	text
  + bitmap (2 colors) and image (+ IMG package? PPM/PGM and GIF by default)
  + cursors
  + experiment with focus -force! + lower/raise
  + font manipulation functions + homogeneity of fonts between R and Tk
  + styles must be handled with option! + tk_setPalette?
  + GUI designer for fixed place of widgets
  + tk/tkvars to retrieve various tk informations
  + use winfo

- Make a demo section

- Add the documentation for tile and update to ttk in tk 8.5
